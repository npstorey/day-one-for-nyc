      <strong>Day One for NYC</strong> is an independent, nonpartisan resource designed to help a new mayoral administration hit the ground running. It is not affiliated with any campaign or candidate. Our goal is to give the public — and incoming leaders — clear, actionable information about how the City of New York works, <a href="/scope-of-mayoral-power/">the powers of the mayor</a>, and the steps needed to govern effectively from day one.
    </p>

    <h3>What We Cover</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Key <a href="/levers/">levers</a> of mayoral power and how to use them</li>
      <li>Critical <a href="/appointments/">appointments</a> and confirmation processes</li>
      <li>Important citywide <a href="/calendars/">calendars</a> and legal deadlines</li>
      <li>Tools, reports, and <a href="/resources/">resources</a> for informed decision-making</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The first 100 days of a new administration set the tone for the next four years.</li>
      <li>Understanding the scope of mayoral power — and its limits — helps prioritize urgent actions.</li>
    </ul>
